# Mental-Wellness-Chatbot

Mental Wellness Chatbot is a full-stack web application designed to assist users in managing their emotional well-being through intelligent, empathetic conversations powered by AI.

# Problem Statement

Mental health poses as a major challenge yet many hesitate to seek help. While AI based mental wellness applications exist, they often lack real time emotional analysis, proactive intervention and personalized insights.
Additionally, existing chatbots may unintentionally reinforce negative thoughts rather than redirecting users toward appropriate care.

# Proposal

I am planning to build a software application - full stack web application which uses chatbot primarily to interact with user.
What makes it stand out is the following:

1. Proactive intervention: Implement a mechanism where the chatbot recognizes distress signals and stops the conversation.
2. Personalized insights: Provide users with personalized reports and visualizations to track emotional well being over time.
3. Handling sensitive user conversations: Implementing data obfuscation techniques to help enhance privacy and security.

# Steps

STEP 1: Chatbot Integration
STEP 2: Sentiment scoring and proactive intervention using VADER
STEP 3: Chatbot Backend Development using Flask API
STEP 4: Frontend development and UI design using React.js
STEP 5: Power BI integration with personalized insights
STEP 6: Data Privacy and security measures using Tokenization, Row level security and JWT.
