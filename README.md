# Mental-Wellness-Chatbot

Mental Wellness Chatbot is a full-stack web application designed to assist users in managing their emotional well-being through intelligent, empathetic conversations powered by AI.

# Problem Statement

Mental health poses as a major challenge yet many hesitate to seek help. While AI based mental wellness applications exist, they often lack real time emotional analysis, proactive intervention and personalized insights.
Additionally, existing chatbots may unintentionally reinforce negative thoughts rather than redirecting users toward appropriate care.

# Proposal

I am planning to build a software application - full stack web application which uses chatbot primarily to interact with user.
What makes it stand out is the following:

1. Proactive intervention: Implement a mechanism where the chatbot recognizes distress signals and stops the conversation.
2. Personalized insights: Provide users with personalized reports and visualizations to track emotional well being over time.
3. Handling sensitive user conversations: Implementing data obfuscation techniques to help enhance privacy and security.

# Steps

STEP 1: Chatbot Integration.
• Integrated BlenderBot-3B via the Hugging Face Inference API.
The first phase of the project involved integrating a conversational AI model to serve as the foundation of the mental wellness chatbot. For this purpose, I used BlenderBot-3B, a powerful open-domain chatbot developed by Facebook via the Hugging Face Inference API. This integration allowed the chatbot to generate human-like, context-aware responses based on user input.
• Prompt customization to define chatbot behavior.
To tailor the chatbot specifically for mental wellness support, a custom system prompt was defined.
"You are a mental wellness assistant. Your goal is to provide compassionate, supportive, and evidence-based responses to users struggling with emotional distress."
• This system prompt was prepended to every user message, meaning that before each message is sent to the model, it is combined with the system prompt. This approach ensures that the chatbot remains consistent in tone and purpose across all interactions. Regardless of the user input, the model is constantly reminded to respond with empathy, supportiveness and relevance to mental health.
• The integration with Hugging Face was accomplished using Python's requests module, where HTTP POST requests were made to the API with properly structured JSON payloads. The response, once received, was parsed and returned back to the user via the backend API.
• This step was crucial in establishing a functional and personality-aware chatbot that serves as the conversational core of the application.

STEP 2: Sentiment scoring and proactive intervention using VADER.
In this phase, the chatbot was enhanced with the ability to assess the emotional tone of user input and take proactive steps when distress is detected. To achieve this, the system integrates VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) which is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically tuned for analyzing sentiments expressed in social media and short text messages.
For this application, the compound score is extracted and converted into a distress score, scaled from 0 to 100%. This distress score serves as a quantifiable indicator of the user's emotional state.
Based on the computed distress score, the system follows two conditional paths:
• If distress_score ≥ 80%:
The chatbot interprets the user’s input as highly distressing. To prioritize user safety it ends the current conversation, displays a professional resource link, disables further interaction by locking the input field (chat box) in the front end.
• If distress_score < 80%:
The chatbot continues the conversation normally, offering empathetic and supportive replies generated by the AI model.

This feature ensures that the chatbot is not just conversational but also emotionally intelligent, able to recognize signs of serious emotional distress and respond with care, caution and responsibility.
This phase significantly elevates the chatbot’s role from a simple conversational agent to a support tool with mental wellness awareness and proactive intervention capabilities.

STEP 3: Chatbot Backend Development using Flask API.
In this phase, a robust and scalable backend service was developed using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. The backend serves as the core of the chatbot system, responsible for managing all interactions between the front end, the sentiment analysis engine and the chatbot model.
The backend exposes a RESTful API with clearly defined endpoints to handle communication logic, perform sentiment scoring and process intelligent responses via a conversational AI model.
Endpoints Implemented:
• GET /
A simple route to confirm that the API is up and running. Useful for monitoring and deployment readiness checks.
• POST /chat
Accepts user input as a JSON payload.
Performs sentiment analysis on the message using VADER.
Forwards the message to the chatbot model (via Hugging Face API).
Returns the generated response along with the distress score and if applicable, intervention instructions.

STEP 4: Frontend development and UI design using React.js.
This phase focused on creating a user-friendly and responsive frontend interface that allows users to interact with the mental wellness chatbot in real time. The front end was built using React.js, chosen for its component-based structure, flexibility and ability to handle dynamic UI updates efficiently.
The goal was to design an interface that not only enables smooth communication but also responds appropriately to the emotional tone of user inputs by reflecting distress-aware behaviors.
• Real-Time Message Exchange:
Users can send and receive messages instantly. The UI updates seamlessly to display both user inputs and chatbot responses in a conversational format.
• Distress-Triggered UI Behavior:
If the chatbot detects a distress score of 80% or higher:
A message alert is displayed to indicate concern.
The input field is disabled, preventing further interaction for the user's safety.
A professional help resource link is shown, encouraging the user to seek immediate support.
• Input Management:
The input field is automatically cleared after each message is sent and a loading indicator appears while awaiting the chatbot's response.
• API Integration with Backend:
All user messages are sent to the Flask backend through axios, and responses are handled using JSON. The React frontend manages all UI updates based on the backend’s replies, including sentiment scores and intervention instructions.
This frontend implementation ensures that the chatbot is not only intelligent in its responses but also visually responsive to the user's emotional state, enhancing the overall supportiveness.

STEP 5: Power BI integration with personalized insights
STEP 6: Data Privacy and security measures using Tokenization, Row level security and JWT.
